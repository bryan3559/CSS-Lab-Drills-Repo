            <h2>Preparation</h2>
            <p>To start, purchase 4 racks of spareribs from your local supermarket. The spareribs should be approx. 2 1/2 to 3 1/2 lbs combined. To prepare the ribs for smoking, first rinse them and remove the membrane on each slab. Next, season and rub your ribs with your favorite spices. I've included a link to one of my favorite rub recipes for your convenience. Allow the ribs to marinate for approx. 1 hour. While the ribs are marinating, prepare your fire.</p>

            <h2>Firing Up the Grill</h2>
            <p>When I cook low and slow, my wood of choice is hickory wood. Hickory wood adds that deep smoke flavoring that we all associate with southern barbecue. To start the fire, add charcoal to a chimney starter. If don't have a chimney starter, I suggest that you make the investment. It's the best way to go when lighting charcoal. I purchased mine from Lowes and I have added a link below if you would like to purchase one. Now back to lightling the charcoal. After adding the charcoal to the chimney starter, stuff newspaper in the bottom of the starter and light. The chimney starter should then be placed on a flat, even surface. Once all of the charcoal has turned grey, you are ready to go. The charcoal heating process typically takes 30 mins.</p>
