            <h2>Preparation</h2>
            <p>To start, purchase 4 racks of spareribs from your local supermarket. The spareribs should be approx. 2 1/2 to 3 1/2 lbs combined. To prepare the ribs for smoking, first rinse them and remove the membrane on each slab. Next, season and rub your ribs with your favorite spices. I've included a link to one of my favorite rub recipes for your convenience. Allow the ribs to marinate for approx. 1 hour. While the ribs are marinating, prepare your fire.</p>

            <h2>Firing Up the Grill</h2>
            <p>When I cook low and slow, my wood of choice is hickory wood. Hickory wood adds that deep smoke flavoring that we all associate with southern barbecue. To start the fire, add charcoal to a chimney starter. If don't have a chimney starter, I suggest that you make the investment. It's the best way to go when lighting charcoal. I purchased mine from Lowes and I have added a link below if you would like to purchase one. Now back to lightling the charcoal. After adding the charcoal to the chimney starter, stuff newspaper in the bottom of the starter and light. The chimney starter should then be placed on a flat, even surface. Once all of the charcoal has turned grey, you are ready to go. The charcoal heating process typically takes 30 mins.</p>

            <h2>Time to Cook!</h2>
            <p>Pour approx. 20 charcoal bricks inside of the side-barrel smoker. Please note that there is no need to light. Next pour in the heated charcoal from the charcoal starter chimey (The heated charcoal will ignite the unheated charcoal). Spread charcoal over the bottom surface of the side-smoker. Once this is done, add one log of hickory wood to the top of the charcoal.The log should then begin to ignite and smolder. Make sure that the damper is open during this phase. Allow the log to smolder for approx. 10 mins. Now it's time to add the meat. Make sure to adjust the grill dampers accordingly to allow the necessary airflow. Allow ribs to cook for 5 to 6 hours, adding a new hickory log each hour of the cooking process. It is recommended that a temperature of 225 to 250 degrees be mantained during the process. Heating additional charcoal will be necessary during the cooking process. Try to avoid opening the door of the main cooking chamber during the cooking process if not necessary. Each rib rack should be basted at least once an hour. This should be done in conjuction with stoking the fire with a fresh hickory log. Once each slab or rack reaches an internal temperature of between 180 to 195 degrees, the ribs are ready to come off of the grill. If you don't already have a meat thermometer, I've added a link below for a cost-efficient one at Lowes.</p>
